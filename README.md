# lake-reservoir-dataset
This is a lake and reservoir dataset

This lake and reservoir dataset contains a total of 140 lake or reservoir samples. The data are derived from 26 scene Gaofen-1 WFV images, which are widely distributed in six geographic regions of China. The samples are cropped based on the buffer zone vector of the lakes and reservoirs, and the labels is produced mainly in two steps, including coarse extraction and manual refinement correction. The lake and reservoir samples provided in this dataset are all larger than 300 pixels, none of them are uniformly cropped, and the researcher can crop them to 256 or 128 or other size according to individual needs.

The tools used for sample production include: Python, IDL, GDAL package, and Arcgis software.

This dataset is free for scientific research and commercial use is strictly prohibited. Please cite the source for citations.

该湖泊水库数据集共计包含140个湖泊或水库样本数据。数据来源于26景高分一号WFV影像，影像广泛分布在全国六大地理分区，样本依据湖泊水库缓冲区矢量裁剪而成，标签制作主要包括粗提取和精修正两个步骤。本数据集提供的湖泊水库样本均大于300像素，均未统一裁剪，研究者可以根据个人需要裁剪为256或128或其他。

使用工具包括：Python、IDL、GDAL包、Arcgis软件。

该数据集供科学研究免费使用，严禁用于商业用途。引用请标明出处。
